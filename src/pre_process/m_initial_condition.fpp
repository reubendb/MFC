!! @brief Contains module m_initial_condition

!> @brief This module provides a platform that is analagous to constructive
!!              solid geometry techniques and in this way allows for the creation
!!              of a wide variety of initial conditions. Several 1D, 2D and 3D
!!              fundamental geometries are included that may further be combined
!!              into more complex shapes. This is achieved by carefully setting
!!              up the order in which the patches are laid out in the domain and
!!              specifying the priority that each patch has over the preceeding
!!              ones. The resulting shapes may be identified both by the values
!!              of their primitive variables and the associated patch identities.
!!              Note that the user may choose to read in and modify a preexisting
!!              initial condition. The module m_start_up.f90 is responsible for
!!             reading in the relevant data files.

        !!              type of geometry associated with a particular patch, it
        !!              calls the related subroutine to setup the said geometry
        !!              on the grid using the primitive variables included with
        !!              the patch parameters. The subroutine is complete once the
