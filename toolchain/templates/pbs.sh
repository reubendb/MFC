#> This file is part of the ./mfc.sh run subsystem.

#> - You are invited to modify this file to suit your
#>   needs, in order to get MFC running properly on
#>   your system.
#>
#> - Lines that begin with "#>" are ignored and won't
#>   figure in the final batch script, not even as a
#>   comment.
#>
#> - Statements of the form `${expression}` are string-
#>   -replaced by mfc.sh run to provide runtime parameters,
#>   most notably execution options. They reference the
#>   variables in the same format as those under the "run"
#>   section of [mfc.user.yaml](mfc.user.yaml), replacing
#>   "-" for "_". You can perform therein any Python operation
#>   recognized by the built-in `expr()` function.
#>
#> - Statements of the form {MFC::expression} tell MFC
#>   where to place the common code, across all batch
#>   files that is required to run MFC. They are not
#>   intended to be modified by users.
